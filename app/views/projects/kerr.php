                    <h2>Objectives</h2>
                    <p>Kerr approached us after we transformed the website of their sister company, Flow Valve. We transformed Valves website from nothing more than an SEO focussed page into a beautiful dynamic website, with crisp responsive designs. However, Kerr required something much more complex and handed us the task of creating a custom CMS from the ground up. Alongside the custom CMS, our developers produced an efficient database structure to hold the vast amount of data that would be put onto the website. Paired with a file structure system, Kerr was safe in the knowledge all of their online clients would have no trouble navigating their site effectively with no glitches. </p>
